Python Straight to the Point
===================================

Learn Programming the Way I Wish I Was Taught

Preface
--------------

A fun fact about this book is that coming up with the subtitle was a no-brainer to me: learn programming the way I wish I was taught. 
Being primarily a self-taught software developer, grasping the fundamental concepts was a big struggle to me in the beginning. 
I found that most online resources out there are extremely similar to one another, and I felt the need for an explanation that was more relatable to me. 
Also, I have fallen into a classic trap: diving right into learning frameworks. 
These frameworks are pre-built sets of reusable components that can speed up the development of a program. 
In Python, they are very popular in the realm of web development and machine learning. We are hard-wired into pursuing shiny things, and that’s the case with
frameworks. Don’t get me wrong, there’s absolutely no problem in using them. You definitely should use them, 
but that is as long as you are actually familiar with the language. I learned the hard way that this shortcut is not worthwhile…
In short, my basic advice is: learn the fundamentals. Take baby steps. Read and practice the concepts in this book.

This is basic neuroscience: it’s only by a constant exposure to a subject that your brain will develop the neural networks required to assimilate the concepts. 
Start by practicing the examples as they are shown, then modify them, play around, explore the possibilities.
You will find a pattern in the chapters:
   
   1. **The concept itself**. What it is, what it’s used for.
   2. **A real-life analogy**. From Biology, Business and Mathematics. The goal is to present the concepts in a more relatable way.
   3. **Examples**. Start using the concept right away, in its most basic form.
   4. **Notes and extra information**. That covers mostly questions to answers I had myself, and other relevant things.
