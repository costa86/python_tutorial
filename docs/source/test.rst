This is a paragraph of text in the section. You can emphasize text using *italic* or **bold** style.

You can also create bullet lists:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Numbered lists look like this:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

You can include inline code by enclosing it in double backquotes: ``print()``.
