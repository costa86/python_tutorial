Functions
============================

The concept of function in programming is derived from the mathematical concept with the same name. 
In mathematics, a function is a rule that maps a set of input values to a set of outputs.

As a real-world analogy, think of a function as a vending machine. In order to use it, you select the product you want and insert the payment. 
Both of them can be seen as the inputs. Then the machine processes them and gives you the desired product, which can be seen as the output of the function.
